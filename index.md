LameJam is a game jam for newbies and veterans alike. Have you been interested
in making games, but the idea of joining a game jam was too daunting? Let us
help!

LameJam is dedicated to being a welcoming place for new game jammers. Learn
about making games, making friends, and hopefully make this your _first_ game
jam, not your last.

# What is a Game Jam?

A game jam is an event where people get together to make games for a set period
of time. These games typically follow the same theme, which is only provided the
first day of the jam. In game jams, you can opt to either work alone or in
groups, but typically game jams are more fun when you're working together! You
can either bring a team or find a team day-of.

You can expect to design your game on Friday, and maybe even get a small
prototype that you can play. From then until Sunday afternoon you'll be
developing and playtesting your game alongside the other jammers. While some
people like to jam all night long, we encourage going home and getting a shower,
a good night's sleep, and some relaxation. You will always work better on a
fresh body and mind!

So what's the goal of a game jam? That is something unique to everyone. Some
people come in to learn a new piece of technology, like a new game engine or
programming language. Many people have the goal of "just finish!" where all they
want to do is complete a game by the jam end period. Whether your goals are
product-based or learning-based, this is a great place for you to learn _and_
create as you see fit.

On the last day of the game jam, games are shown to the other jammers and
everybody breathes a sigh of relief and swaps stories of the weekend while
playing each other's games.

# What is LameJam?

We think making games is great, and should be accessible to anybody interested.
We created LameJam to introduce new people to the world of game development and
game jamming. To do this, we have introduced support mentors and game
development talks from local university instructors, students, and industry
professionals.

LameJam lasts three days: Friday November 26th - Sunday November 28th. On Friday we will be
holding a workshop on how to use the Godot Game Engine, a free, compact, and
open-source game engine for 2D and 3D games. We will discuss game design and
some tips to get you started on your first game jam. This is also when the theme
will be revealed!

Saturday is a work-day, but we also plan to have some talks about game design
and development running throughout the day if you need a break. We're always
looking for more speakers, so if you would be interested in giving a talk, let
us know!

Whether this is your first game jam, or just your latest, we want to provide a
fun and safe environment for everybody to enjoy. Meet the local game dev
community, learn something new, and have fun making games.
