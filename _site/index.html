            <div><p>LameJam is a game jam for newbies and veterans alike. Have you been interested in making games, but the
idea of joining a game jam was too daunting? Let us help!</p>

<p>LameJam is dedicated to being a welcoming place for new game jammers. Learn about making games, making friends,
and hopefully make this your <em>first</em> game jam, not your last.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-game-jam">What is a Game Jam?</h1>

<p>A game jam is an event where people get together to make games for a set period of time.
These games typically follow the same theme, which is only provided the first day of the jam.
In game jams, you can opt to either work alone or in groups, but typically game jams are more fun when you’re working together! You can either 
bring a team or find a team day-of.</p>

<p>You can expect to design your game on Friday, and maybe even get a small prototype that you can play. From then until Sunday
afternoon you’ll be developing and playtesting your game alongside the other jammers. While some people like to jam all night long,
we encourage going home and getting a shower, a good night’s sleep, and some relaxation. You will always work better on a 
fresh body and mind!</p>

<p>So what’s the goal of a game jam? That is something unique to everyone. Some people come in to learn a new
piece of technology, like a new game engine or programming language. Many people have the goal of “just finish!” where 
all they want to do is complete a game by the jam end period. Whether your goals are product-based or learning-based,
this is a great place for you to learn <em>and</em> create as you see fit.</p>

<p>On the last day of the game jam, games are shown to the other jammers and everybody breathes a sigh of relief and
swaps stories of the weekend while playing each other’s games.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-lamejam">What is LameJam?</h1>

<p>We think making games is great, and should be accessible to anybody interested. We created LameJam to introduce
new people to the world of game development and game jamming. To do this, we have introduced support mentors and 
game development talks from local university instructors, students, and industry professionals.</p>

<p>LameJam lasts three days: Friday May 8th - Sunday May 10th. On Friday we will be holding a workshop on how to use
the Godot Game Engine, a free, compact, and open-source game engine for 2D and 3D games. We will discuss game design and
some tips to get you started on your first game jam. This is also when the theme will be revealed!</p>

<p>Saturday is a work-day, but we also plan to have some talks about game design and development running throughout the day
if you need a break. We’re always looking for more speakers, so if you would be interested in giving a talk, let us know!</p>

<p>Whether this is your first game jam, or just your latest, we want to provide a fun and safe environment for everybody to 
enjoy. Meet the local game dev community, learn something new, and have fun making games.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-join-or-help-out">How do I Join or Help Out?</h1>

<p>If you would like to sign up for Lame Jam and/or get email updates as the event gets closer, <a href="#">sign up here!</a>. Detailed
schedules, locations, and speaker lists will be announced as the date approaches.</p>

<p>If you would like to help volunteer, we’d love to have your help! We are seeking in-person and remote volunteers to help with coordination 
and mentoring. If you would be interested in either helping to run the event or mentoring new developers, please <a href="#">inquire here.</a></p>

<p>If you are an industry professional interested in sponsorship, mentoring, or speaking about anything relating to games, game development,
or the local game development community, <a href="#">let us know!</a> We would love to promote local game development efforts and hear from you.</p>
