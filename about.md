## The Team, The Goals
LameJam is coordinated by a small group of volunteers from Ottawa, made up of of games enthusiasts, students, developers, instructors, and jammers. Our first event in 2018 was run with the assistance of the Carleton University School of Computer Science and the Carleton Computer Science Society, and is now being operated online for all to access!

Our goals with LameJam remain unchanged; we want to encourage people to create, to learn, and to have fun. While game jamming is a distinct skill from working in the games industry, it's a fantastic outlet for creativity and a great way to meet people. We think everyone can learn to make games, and we want to invite folks that would otherwise avoid something like a game jam. There's **no competition** here. There's no expectations, and there's no judgement. We want LameJam to be a game jam where you can feel comfortable trying something new, whether that's trying a game jam at all or taking on a new role in jams. 

With any success and luck, we hope to continue running this event anually and continuing to bring game development to new faces. By showing some support for LameJam, you will also be supporting future events relating to the local game scene! 

## What does LameJam look like?

With LameJam being online this year, the majority of the jam will take place on Discord. You can join the Discord server before the event, and sign up on Itch.io so that you can submit a game at the end. First you can choose to attend a game engine workshop and get a rough overview of how game engines work; even if you don't intend to code, it's still useful to know about the tech you'll be using. **Note:** Non-digital games are fully allowed! Provide instructions and printables instead of game executables.

Then we will announce the **theme**. All game submissions should revolve around the theme in some way, but it is not restricted to any one definition. Feel free to interpret it however you like! We will go over the schedule for the weekend and give another chance for anyone to jump into teams. Feel free to organize teams before the jam on our Discord, but you can always keep an eye out for teams taking on new members. We highly encourage taking on new team mates and meeting some new people during the jam!

Once the theme is announced, it's up to you! We will be hosting a variety of small talks throughout the weekend to teach game and jam skills, as well as a few more industry focused talks of interest to encourage taking breaks over the weekend. We **strongly** encourage healthy jam conditions; take breaks, get exercise, eat healthy, and wrap up your work day early enough to unwind and get a good night's sleep. Sleep and relaxation are critical to your creativity and productivity through the weekend!

Ideally, you will have *something* which can be played by Saturday afternoon at the latest. It's quite a tall order, so try to keep your game idea small! REALLY small! The goal is to get the game into other jammers hands early and make improvements over the weekend, not to just finish your initial idea at the last second. Of course, game jams can be unpredictable, so don't feel bad if you don't even have anything playable by the end of the weekend. That's perfectly fine. We strongly encourage **posting your game builds** periodically through the weekend and asking for playtesters. We will have some specified times throughout where we encourage breaks and playtesting.

Finally, on Sunday, you can submit your game and we'll break away into channels to do some playtesting. Try out each other's games, realize it was a tough weekend for everyone, and don't compare yourself to others - just appreciate the work they did, the work you did, and the great time you will have in your *next* game jam.

A rough outline of the weekend looks like the following:

- Friday
    - Opening workshops on how to use game engines
    - Team formations
    - A welcome panel from the organizers going over the event
    - Theme announcement
    - Talks on jam skills
- Saturday
